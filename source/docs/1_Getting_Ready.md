## 1.1 JetMax Introduction

### 1.1.1 Introduction

JetMax is an intelligent robotic arm capable of deep learning and computer vision. Powered by Jetson Nano, it is equipped with high definition camera for effective interaction with perceived environment. JetMax is able to turn your AI ideas into reality.

Compared with traditional robotic arm, JetMax's end can be loaded with various end-of-tools, which makes it possible to pick, transfer goods, as well as suck the goods, draw and write with the suction cup and pen holder.

Combining with these features, JetMax can realize waste sorting, object sequencing, gesture recognition, etc. There is no doubt that we carry the functions of JetMax to its extreme.

## 1.2 Getting Readying

### 1.2.1 Antenna, suction cup and device placement

Insert the antennas at the position shown in the figure below, then rotate to tighten them.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_2/media/image2.png" style="width:500px" />

Install the suction cups to the four corners of the base, circled in the picture, and fix them with nuts.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_2/media/image3.jpeg" style="width:500px" />

Unfold the map on the desktop. Then place the robotic arm within the contour on the map. And the front of the robotic arm should be aligned with the front line of the contour, and the suction cups should fit the desktop tightly.

### 1.2.2 Map composition

Before controlling the JetMax, let's have a look at the map. The map consists of four parts, including ①vision recognition area, ② sorting area, ③ robotic arm placing area and ④ sequencing area.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_2/media/image5.jpeg" style="width:500px" />

① vision recognition area

The vision recognition area is the robotic arm's visual field. The cards and blocks to be recognized need to be placed within this area.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Note: please don't place the cards or blocks in the edge of the recognition area so as to avoid recognition failure.**

② Sorting area

The robotic arm will transfer the cards or blocks from the recognition area to the placing area.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_2/media/image6.png" style="width:500px" />

The functions of above areas are as follow.

### 1.3.2 Boot up

1. Push the switch on the expansion board to "**ON**". After a while, the LED light on it will flash continuously. When the buzzer sounds "**beep**" for three times, it means the robotic arm boots up successfully.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_3/media/image3.jpeg" style="width:500px" alt="2021-09-29_14-08-51" />

2. After booting up, JetMax will be in AP direct connection mode by default and will launch a Wi-Fi starting with HW.
